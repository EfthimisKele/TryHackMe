I am an undergraduate student with a early intermediate experience in hacking! I study Computer Science  and my future goal is to become a certified penetration tester and help people who want to work in this field as much as I can.
I hope I will do most of the rooms, trying to maximize what I can learn in the process and do useful writeups! ðŸ˜Š
